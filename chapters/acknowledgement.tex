At this point I would like to thank everyone who supported me during the preparation of this thesis.

My thanks go to my supervisor Prof. Dr. Hans Michael-Windisch for his support in the preparation of this thesis. I would also like to express a special thanks to Tabea Spahn and Nils Wei√ü. Without their help and support this work would not have been possible.

Last but not least, I would like to thank all my friends who were patient with me during the writing of this thesis and showed great understanding. Jeonghyeon Ha, Florian Weber and Nikola Brandl deserve a separate mention for proofreading.
